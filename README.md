# Excel-project
This is the project worked on the last semester which would automatically update in the final excel sheet based on the first 4 excel sheet as the tutor adds the data. Through this they will be able to calculate the final teaching hours of the student.
### The tools used are:
### 1.Excel ( 4 excel the first 3 is for data entry and last excel calculates the teaching hours )
### 2. office script ( To apply logic into excel - used when working with lots of data)
### 3. power automation : used to trigger or update automatically without human each time manually triggering
### 4. sharepoint : can be share to the known one to protect the data
### 5. One drive : to store the data safely
